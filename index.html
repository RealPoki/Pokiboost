      <p>Welcome to POKIBOOST.
Ok guys, i have many experience in boosting and shit tbh and im really good in cs go and dota 2 tbh.
On the right u can see my dota 2 ingame graph and my mmr. Im easiesly the best dota 2 and cs go player in the whole eu tbh U can see above my cs go rank and see that im even better then Global elite.</p>

<p>Here are all the amazing pictures i have

<p>One of my satisfied customers said that he liked my boosting service really good tbh 
"Shroomqings: He brought me from silver 1 to global in no time tbh would spend 322 euro again.</p>

<p>Another satisfied customer "Inzane: I was on brink of going under 1k mmr he said hell need my account for 3days boosting and after like 3 days i looked at my account and im like 5.5k mmr AMAZING tbh. i think ill buy the boosting service for csgo too.</p>

<p>"Kurro: Man i wish i bought the Platinum pakage instead of the gold pakage, he boosted me one day in csgo from silver 3 to dmg, now i have to buy boosting service again but atleast at a reduced price tbh, 32/2 would boost again.</p>

<p>I changed there names for saftey tbh.
See like everyone liked my boosting service tbh.</p>

<p>U will not regret buying my service, it will only cost like 200€ the hours and maybe u can get a discount tbh.
U will pay with paypal beforehand and there will be no refunds tbh.
There are like 3 pakages i have to offer:
Silver Pakage: Will boost u in cs go to gold 4 or in dota to 3k mmr for like 200€</p>

<p>Gold Pakage : Will boost u in csgo to dmg or in dota to 4k mmr for like 300€</p>

<p>Platinum Pakage tbh : Will boost u in csgo to global elite and in dota to 5k mmr for like 500€</p>

<p>Super Amazing Ultra gold platinum dark matter pakage: Will boost u in csgo to global elite 2 like i am and in dota to 7k mmr for only like 6000€
If u buy a low tier pakege then the next pakege will be like 25% off tbh maybe.
Mfg best player in the whole eu.</p>
